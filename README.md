# Hey, I'm Brandon! ðŸ˜Š

### About Me:
I'm a computer science new grad from UCR looking for a SWE/MLE position. During my time at UCR I was involved with machine learning research in the area of health informatics and wireless communication systems. 

In 2020 I completed a **NASA** sponsored microcomputer & robotics internship that involved designing and building a lunar rovar prototype. My project featured a mock rover that changed positions based on incoming light frequencies.

In 2022 I spent my summer as a data science challenge participant for **Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory**. I spent my time doing data mining on a protein-binding dataset for the purpose of drug discovery. 

#### Some things I am passionate about are: 
- Data Science ðŸ’»
- Robotics ðŸ¤–
- Coffee â˜•
